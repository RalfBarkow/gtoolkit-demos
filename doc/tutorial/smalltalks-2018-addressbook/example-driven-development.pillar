! Example Driven Development Example Driven Development is a natural evolution of Test Driven Development (TDD). To explain it, let's start with an address book implementation using test cases. Test !! Test Driven Development Each contact is presented by three objects: ${class:DmAbContact}$, ${class:DmAbAddress}$, and ${class:DmAbTelephone}$. ${class:DmAbAddressBook}$ holds all contacts. The class definitions are the following:${changes:01-domain.ombu}$ Let's write some test cases:${changes:01-tests.ombu}$ Let's execute test cases:[[[(TestRunner new	packageSearchUpdate: 'AddressBook';	classSearchUpdate: 'DmAb';	selectAllPackages;	runAll;	build) height: 250]]]Let's make tests green implementing behavior: ${changes:02-domain-methods.ombu}$Let's execute test cases again: [[[(TestRunner new	packageSearchUpdate: 'AddressBook';	classSearchUpdate: 'DmAb';	selectAllPackages;	runAll;	build) height: 250]]]!!! Documentation and Learning Process When a product is ready to consume, we should also facilitate learning process. Do you agree? If so, what is the common process to support learning and reading? ... A documentation is a common entry point. Developers assemble software documentation commonly as an external documentation, blog posts, etc. There is an example of such documentation: Readers then search, using internet search engines to learn about products
